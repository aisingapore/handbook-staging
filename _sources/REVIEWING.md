Contributor: Kenny WJ Chua

---

Congrats! You have completed a draft of a handbook section. Before committing, please consider the following guidelines on giving and receiving feedback, as well as a checklist of points for self/peer review.

Thanks again for your contributions!

## Giving good feedback					
- Focus on the idea, not the person					
- Follow up with a constructive suggestion					
- Allow the recipient time to react to your feedback
- Point out the things your like
- Be polite—provide the feedback that you would appreciate receiving

## Receiving and integrating feedback
- Feedback is not personal; it is intended to improve the content
- Go through each reviewer’s comments in turn
- Acknowledge the reviewer’s help, consider each piece of feedback, and evaluate if you should accept it
- If you receive contradictory feedback, consider what the reader really needs to know

## Review checklist

Please review your own writing against the following criteria. If there are any deviations, are there strong reasons for them being so?

### Technical

- [ ] Are there technical concepts/terms that need to be explained to the reader?
- [ ] Is there any jargon that might lead to confusion?
- [ ] Are technical terms used in a consistent manner?

### Completeness
- [ ] Does the text provide adequate (but not necessarily exhaustive) information to address the question in an actionable manner?
- [ ] Are there any gaps/assumptions that ought to be explained?
- [ ] Are there links to relevant resources (if applicable)?
- [ ] Are there any incomplete placeholders in the prose?

### Structure

# What are some questions that an AI engineer can ask the project sponsor to assess their AI capabilities?

## Who is this for?
Are you:
- an AI engineer in a solution provider organisation building a solution for another organisation?
- or an in-house AI engineer in an organisation building a solution for another business unit?

If you answer "Yes" above, read on to find out how you can assess the AI readiness level of the organisation or unit, henceforth referred to as "PS" (i.e. project sponsor).

In an organisation, the business development/presales team usually scope for feasible AI projects, while assessing the PS's capabilities to ensure smooth handover of the final AI solution.

## Why does AI engineer need to assess project sponsor's AI capabilities?
Although prior to the development work by the AI engineer, it is best for you to gauge if the PS is capable of taking over your solution for deployment. Most AI projects end up in failures during deployment phase due to three main reasons:

1. Technical hurdles in implementing/integrating model into existing operations
2. Decision makers unwilling to approve change to existing operations
3. Model performance not considered strong enough by decision makers

## What can the AI engineer look out for?
To ensure a successful project, let us focus on three broad areas to help you assess the PS's AI readiness level. 

### 1. Organisational readiness
> Are there competent AI engineers to develop, integrate, and maintain the AI models? 

> Is the management supportive of AI projects and team expansion if necessary?

> Do the management and key stakeholders allow room for experimentation and development?

As an organisation looking to use AI solutions, PS's management should understand that model building and maintenance requires iterative experimentation and continuous re-training, in turn supporting the investment of right talents.

### 2. Infrastructure readiness
> Is there appropriate infrastructure to hold data in a centralised place (e.g. data lake)?

> Are there sufficient computational resources (e.g. CPUs/GPUs, memory) to support model development, deployment, maintenance for this project? If no, are there plans to acquire more / re-allocate resources?

Preparing for such changes strengthens the PS's infrastructure capabilities, easing their transition into the deployment/integration stages with minimal disruption to their existing activities.

### 3. Data readiness
> Does the centralised data warehouse provide consistent data format, up-to-date metadata and a single source of truth?

> Is there accurate and complete data to be used in this project?

It is important for PS to provide high quality and consistent data that can be used for re-training when model drifts over time.
